# cubemx-mmc-sd-card

*2020 Update: A newer version of this project now exists at https://github.com/kiwih/cubeide-sd-card - the newer version uses CubeIDE instead of CubeMX, and has a detailed accompanying blog post explaining how to integrate the driver.*

This project is designed as an example of a STM32CubeMX-generated system with FatFs middleware controlling
an SPI-connected MMC/SD memory card.

The project was initially created in CubeMX, and then code written by ChaN was ported to the CubeMX HAL.

The driver files `Src/user_diskio_spi.c` and `Inc/user_diskio_spi.h` should be usable in any CubeMX project (although the SPI handle `hspi1` may need to be changed depending on your requirements).

The CubeMX project file is `nucleo-sdcard.ioc` in the root directory. You can load this with CubeMX and change any of the settings and regenerate without affecting any of the code in this code base.

### Usage instructions

#### 1. Programmer and gcc

This guide assumes Ubuntu linux.

Firstly, you will need to install texane st-link drivers from https://github.com/texane/stlink

The guide for doing this is https://github.com/texane/stlink/blob/master/doc/compiling.md

Once you have this installed and set up correctly you should be able to run 
`>st-info --chipid` and get a suitable response back (e.g. 0x0446)

You'll also want to install the excellent arm-none-embedded resource (or else you won't be able to compile things).

The guide for doing this is https://launchpad.net/~team-gcc-arm-embedded/+archive/ubuntu/ppa

You'll also want CubeMX (or else why are you here?).

The guide for doing this is http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html (An Ubuntu option is available).

#### 2. Development board

I used the stm32nucleo-f303re development board for this project, but any suitable board should do. 

Connect the SPI lines SCK/MISO/MOSI up to the SD card, and an additional GPIO pin (I used PinB6) as your CS line (Can't use the hardware-controlled CS due to reasons, but you can use the pin it otherwise would be on).

If this isn't SPI1 on your board you'll need to change the two files mentioned previously.

Then, connect a UART TX from the board to a UART RX on your computer. I used UART1.

#### 3. MC/SD memory card

Make sure your memory card is formatted to some flavour of FAT (I used FAT32) and is empty except for a single text file "test.txt". I put "hello world" inside my file.

#### 4. Download and Run

Firstly, you'll want to set up your UART RX. I use `minicom` in a separate terminal to my st-link. You should set it up with baud rate 38400 and hardware flow control off.

Then, you need to download the program to your micro.

I modified the default makefile from CubeMX to include a `make download` command.

It should say something like this:
```
make download

```

In your minicom, something along the lines of the following should now appear:

```

```

The nice thing with this project is that everything is compatible with CubeMX templates, so you can change your CubeMX settings and regenerate the code without breaking anything.
